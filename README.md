A comprehensive data science project analyzing 255,168 Tic-Tac-Toe games using machine learning techniques to predict game outcomes and understand strategic patterns.
🎯 Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of game theory and machine learning by analyzing a complete dataset of Tic-Tac-Toe games. While Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game, it provides rich insights into:

Statistical game analysis
Classification algorithms
Feature importance
The gap between model accuracy and real-world performance

Key Findings

📊 81.2% baseline accuracy with Logistic Regression
🌲 85%+ accuracy with Random Forest (with successful draw predictions!)
🎯 Center square yields 60.5% win rate (optimal opening move)
⚠️ High accuracy doesn't guarantee good gameplay performance
